    "# Introductory Homework\n",

    "The main goal of this homework is to introduce the format and practice homework submission. You should answer the following questions in a single .pdf document that will be submitted to Gradescope. The .pdf may be generated directly from the .ipynb, or created using a word processing program of your choice. There are no explicit limits on length, but conciseness is appreciated.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also submit the .pdf report along with all associated analysis scripts and data in a .zip file through Canvas. This .zip file should contain everything needed to reproduce your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homeworks, including this one, will also be \"peer graded\". As a grader, your responsibility is to list at least one strength and one weakness of the assignment, ensuring that all criticism is constructive. Failure to complete peer grading within one week of a submission deadline will affect the \"Peer Grading\" portion of your final grade."
