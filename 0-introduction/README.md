## Overview

This "module" is a template for how the course will be organized. Each module will have a "README.md" file that contains recommended reading and an overview of the module content. There may also be an associated "data" folder that contains any data relevant to the module, and an "images" folder that contains images used in the module. There will also be several .ipynb files, which are Jupyter notebooks that contain the lecture, exercises, and project definitions.

If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, you should follow the [quick start](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) guide to learn how to open them.
