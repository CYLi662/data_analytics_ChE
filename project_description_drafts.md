# Spectral analysis

## Problem Definition: The overall goal of this project is to establish an automated workflow for (1) determining peaks in IR spectra and (2) comparing different IR spectra. The algorithm should be capable of determining the number of peaks present in a given spectra, the locations of the peaks, and the widths of the peaks. The program should also be able to compare up to 10 different spectra at a time based on the peaks or other features.

# Chemical process data

## Problem Definition: The overall goal of this project is to establish a model capable of predicting the impurty level in the Dow chemical process as a function of the operating parameters. The model should be optimized to balance performance and complexity, and should minimize the number of operating conditions needed to make an accurate prediction.

# Perovskite data

## Problem Definition: The overall goal of this project is to identify promising perovskite materials for solar water splitting. The model should consider two factors: the synthesizability of the perovskite and the bandgap of the perovskite.
